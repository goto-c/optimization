We calculated the square error as the target function, in the project 00_random ~ 03_newton.
In this project, we can visualize the square error by plotting them on the z-axis.  
The red dots on the gray plane show the random dots created by the function create_random_points().  
As shown in this project, the closer to the center, the squared error becomes smaller, which means that the optimized point is supposed to be around (0, 0) .
