# 01_gradient_descent

This project simulates the gradient discent method of optimization.  
  
## Initial configuration  
500 points are randomly generated on the OpenGL window.  
  
## Simulation  
1. A target point is generated on the top-right position on the window.
2. Gradient of square error is calculated at the current target position.
3. The target point moves in the opposite direction of the gradient.
4. Iterate above 1 ~ 3 until the calculated gradient is lower than a certain value ( ideally, gradient converges to zero).
